USB Audio 2.0 Reference Design Board
------------------------------------

.. note::
        This hardware should not be used for the basis of a new design.

The `USB Audio 2.0 Reference Design <https://www.xmos.com/support/boards?product=14772>`_ is a
stereo hardware reference design available from XMOS based on an XMOS L8 device (previously named L1).
The diagram in  :ref:`usb_audio_l1_hw_diagram` shows the block layout of the USB Audio
2.0 Reference Design board. The main purpose of the XS1 L-Series device is to
provide a USB Audio interface to the USB PHY and route the audio to
the audio CODEC and S/PDIF output. Note, although the software
supports MIDI, there are no MIDI connectors on the board.

For full hardware details please refer to the `USB Audio 2.0 Ref Design XS1-L1 Hardware Manual
<https://www.xmos.com/published/usb-audio-20-ref-design-xs1-l1-hardware-manual>`_.
